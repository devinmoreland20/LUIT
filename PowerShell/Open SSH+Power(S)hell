#First verify you have Open SSH

#If both the client and server are installed skip to Line 24. 

#To install OpenSHH Client, will require restart and update of PC
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0


#Install the OpenSSH Server
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
#Here you may get and error in red letters. Run the following if you do
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Msix.PackagingTool.Driver~~~~0.0.1.0
#Restart+Update PC
#If you restarted rerun the command at line 13. 

#Then verify our serverices are workring 
    Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
#If both are installed then follow the next steps. 

#Now that OpenSSH client and server are both install we need to start our SSH services. 
    Start-Service sshd
    Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'      
#This will make it start up automatically everytime we start Powershell
#Next we will confirm firewall is configured. You will have to hit enter at the end. Input all the following text in as one command.

#If this gives you red letters+error then we need to start the service in the GUI. I don't know how to do it in Powershell. 
#Type services in your search bar. Find OpenSSH Authentication and set Startup type to automatic. Click Apply
#Then run 
    Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType
#Should say automatic.

#Then start the ssh-agent

#Then run ssh-add to add out key pair and you golden, make sure your path to the file is correct.
