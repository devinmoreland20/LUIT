#To add updates to the staging area


git add <filename>
git add -A           #adds multiple files at once to the staging area. 

git commit -m "reason for addition"          # will commit it to the repo
git commit -a -m "reason for addition"       #will both add and commit, sometimes it doesnt work though.
