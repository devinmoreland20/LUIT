#I started off uninstalling my OpenSSH client and server so that I will struggle the whole way just like you. 


#First verify you have Open SSH 
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
#If both the client and server are installed skip to Line 24. 

#To install OpenSHH Client
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
#Restart+Update required of PC.

#Install the OpenSSH Server
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
#Here you may get and error in red letters. Run the following if you do
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Msix.PackagingTool.Driver~~~~0.0.1.0
#Restart+Update PC
#If you restarted rerun the command at line 13. 

#Then verify our serverices are workring 
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
#If both are installed then follow the next steps. 

#Now that OpenSSH client and server are both install we need to start our SSH services. 
Start-Service sshd
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'      
#This will make it start up automatically everytime we have start Powershell
#Next we will confirm firewall is configured. You will have to hit enter at the end. Input all the following text in as one command. 
if (!(Get-NetFirewallRule -Name "OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Enabled)) {
    Write-Output "Firewall Rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' does not exist, creating it..."
    New-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
} else {
    Write-Output "Firewall rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' has been created and exists."
}


#Now spin up an EC2 instance. Make a new keypair, we will call ours KeyPair, or use your exisiting and storet it in the /Documents folder. 
#Also get out of Admin and open powershell normally. We want to be able to just run the following command to access our EC2 right? 
#ssh ec2-user@ipaddy rather than inputing the keypair everytime right. 
#We need to be able to run the ssh-add command in Powershell. 

#First we need to start ssh-agent
#Start by seeing if the service is running.  
Get-Service ssh-agent

#If stopped; run
Start-Service ssh-agent

#If this give you red letters+error then we need to start the service in the GUI. I don't know how to do it in Powershell. 
#Type services in your search bar. Find OpenSSH Authentication and set Startup type to automatic. Click Apply
#Then run 
Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType
#Should say automatic.

#Then start the ssh-agent
Start-Service ssh-agent

#Then run ssh-add to add out key pair and you golden.
ssh-add KeyPair(this will be eiter the file name if you are in documents or the actual pathway to your file if not in the parent directory.)
